<h1>About us</h1>
<br>
<p>In September 2003, Studio Evolution Fitness opened its doors for the first time in a cosy little studio that served them well for many years. Located just a few blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Darling Street, their aim was to raise awareness of health & fitness in the Balmain/Rozelle community by assisting people to create their own personal evolution…to gradually change their habits and become a stronger, fitter, healthier and happier person.</p><br>
<p>Having outgrown their Reynolds Street premises, in December 2007 they had the opportunity to relocate closer to Darling Street at 9 Palmer Street in a multi-level studio that was purpose built for them and their clients. This is where they are to this day, still endeavouring to assist the Balmain and Rozelle community to become more aware of the need to invest in their bodies.</p><br>
<p>Maren Preston, owner of Studio Evolution Fitness has noticed a real change over the past 20 years that he has been in the fitness industry since he began when he was 18 years old.</p><br>
<p>“People are working harder and longer hours than ever before. Starting work earlier and finishing later puts a lot of stress on families, especially young families. Being a father of two, I can relate to the lack of time that we can devote to ourselves compared to when we were younger which is why I have developed a training system and strategies that suit my community. We implement these strategies gradually to ensure that the client has adequate time to adjust to new life habits. Some adjustments can be and need to be quite drastic but as long as the client realises that these changes are absolutely necessary then we can work together patiently to get success. ”</p><br>
<p>He further adds;<br>
“I have realised that being healthy for my family is a top priority, and I too deal with the day to day struggles of trying to fit in exercise to keep in the best condition I can be. I only have a handful of hours in any given week to work on my conditioning but I do have 24 hours every day, 7 days a week to work on my nutrition. Ensuring the finest nutrition for not only me but also for my family is my primary focus, as this is where optimum health begins. With this knowledge and experience I can train our clients to exercise more efficiently, eat more purposefully and think positively which I believe are the 3 key elements for change.”</p><br>

<p>Maren and his Trainers Brendan & Steve are here to make that change possible for you.</p><br>
